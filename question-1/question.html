<p class="intro-text">
Tourism grew steadily over time because of social media, and tourism categories grew with it. The biggest tourism categories are not the only one growing over time, but also many other specific and peculiar types of tourism gained popularity on the platform. We investigated Instagram hashtags related to tourism in order to understand which category is represented the most on Instagram. We also analyzed images in order to see what type content is shared through these hashtags.</p>

<div class="main-text">
  <p>Half of the visualization is occupied by the Nature tourism category. Ecotourism is the biggest subcategory, followed by Sustainable tourism. If we take a closer look at the composition and color of the images, we find out that green and blue are the most recurrent colors in this set of images because of the natural elements like water and trees. In fact, 80% of the images in the Ecotourism subcategory show green, blue or both in their images.</p>

  <p>Medical tourism is the third biggest subcategory. People travel in order to get medical treatment abroad, often times because it is cheaper with respect to their country of origin. The predominant colors of this category are white, pink and light-blue. In fact, the images show skin, teeth and ads promoting surgical interventions. The biggest related subcategory is Dental tourism.</p>

  <p>Another subcategory that makes a specific use of colors is Dark tourism. Dark tourism is a movement of people that travel to places historically associated with death and tragedy. In this category the use of blacks and dark greys is above 65% of the total images shown. Quite a lot of images contain skulls or abandoned places.</p>

  <p>The most peculiar subcategory in the visualization is Halal tourism. This kind of tourism is devoted to Muslim families and individuals eager to tour around the world while abiding by the rules of Islam. The Halal tourism industry offers hotels with no alcohol servings, nor pork meals as well as separate swimming pools and SPAs for men and women. In this set of images we can mainly find mosques and women wearing hijabs.</p>
