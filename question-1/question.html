Thereâ€™s a very long list of tourism categories. People travel for many different reasons and sometimes unexpected ones. Have you ever wondered what people travel for? What are the reasons that push us to step out of our door? We investigated Instagram hashtags related to tourism in order to understand which category is represented the most on the platform.

<div class="main-text">
  <p>Half of the visualization is occupied by the Nature tourism category. Ecotourism is the biggest subcategory, followed by sustainable tourism. If we take a closer look at the composition and color of the images, we find out that green and blue are the most recurrent colors in this set of images because of the natural elements like water and trees. In fact, 83% of the images in the ecotourism category show green, blue or both in their images.</p>

  <p>Medical tourism is the third biggest subcategory. People travel in order to get medical treatment abroad, often times because it is cheaper with respect to their country of origin. The predominant colors of this category are white and pink because parts of the body are shown. In fact, 60% of the images show simultaneously the colors white and pink. The biggest related subcategory is Dental Tourism.</p>

  <p>Another subcategory that makes a specific use of colors is Dark Tourism. Dark tourism is a movement of people that travel to places historically associated with death and tragedy. In this category the use of blacks and dark greys is above 65% of the total images shown. Quite a lot of images contain or resemble skulls in them.</p>

  <p>The most peculiar subcategory in the visualization is Halal tourism. This kind of tourism is devoted to Muslim families and individuals want to tour around the world while abiding by the rules of Islam. The Halal tourism industry offers hotels with no alcohol servings, nor pork meals as well as separate swimming pools and spas for men and women. In this set of images there are only women wearing hijabs. </p>
