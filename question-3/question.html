  Dark tourism is a movement of people that travel to places historically associated with death and tragedy. Some people travel with lots of historic interest towards these places, some people don’t even know what dark tourism. We examined the #darktourism Instagram hashtag and co-hashtags found in the picture posted on the platform to define which themes are strictly related to this kind of tourism.

    Among the relevant events, those with no debunked false images - such as
    Ferguson Shooting, Palestinian Refugees in Syria, Israel Assault and others
    - are fewer in number than those with false images declared fake.

    The number of debunked images has significantly increased through the years.
    In 2014 there are 31 images officially declared false, while in 2019 there
    are 82. In addition, 2019 was the year in which individual images were
    debunked more times than in any other year.

  <p>
    Most images have been debunked less than 16 times: this is the starting
    point for an exponential increase of the debunking phenomenon. Only 7 photos
    exceed this threshold: therefore only in rare cases many sites were active
    in declaring false the same image en masse.

    The image declared false the most (45 times) is the one representing a shark
    on a highway linked to the Hurricane Harvey catastrophe, which is also one
    of the most absurd photos.
